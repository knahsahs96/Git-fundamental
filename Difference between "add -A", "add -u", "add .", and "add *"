# Difference between "add -A", "add -u", "add .", and "add *"

## git add -A/--all
-> git status 
-> git add -A/git add --all     (git reset - unstages all the changes)
* it is going to stage all of the changes all the modified, deleted, new and dot files in the entire working tree 

* entire working tree means even if we are in subdirectory and do "git add -A" here still we got all the changes
even though some of the changes were up one directory 

* if we want to add changes only in sub directory but it will not touch anything in top level directory 
-> git add -A my_dir/  

* "git add -A" is default behaviour of "git add" so we can leave of the -a 
git add my_dir/ do the same thing as git add -A my_dir


## git add -u/git add --update 

->git add -u 
* it adds all the modified and deleted files but not any untracked files or not any new files and it work for entire tree

we can also specify directory
-> git add -u my_dir/


#git add . (dot indicate current directory)

-> git add . (it add all the changes)

* git add . and git add -A looks same as long as you are in your top directory and 
it is different when we move to sub directory

-> cd my_dir
-> git add .
*it add all the changes in our current directory but not in our top directory 

-> git add -A
* if you run from anywere it adds all of the changes in the entire working tree

## git add *(not recommended)
it will not include deleted and hidden file and also not add file of top level dir
