# git stash - whenever you have some changes that you are not quite ready to commit and maybe you need to switch branches or you want 
to revert back temporarily to where it was started and you don't know what to do with your changes . where we can do stash on those 
changes it will save them in a temporary place to where you can go and do what it is you need to do and come back to those changes later

 process
 -> git branch branch_name
 -> git checkout branch_name ( changed something)
 -> git diff (see the change we have made)
 
 * due to some reason we need to switch back to our master branch and check something out or 
   we need to see how our current file looked like before we started messing with it. we can stash our changes and to back to where we are
   
 -> git stash save "worked on something"
 
 -> git diff (it will show nothing)
 -> git status (it will show nothin to commit)
 -> git stash list (show the list of stash)
 
 * do the stuff
 and want to get changes back
 -> git checkout branch_name
 -> git stash apply stash@{0}
 
 * now we can see that it has made these changes and when you go back to your file we can see that changes are now back
 
 -> git stash list
 * we can see that our stash is still there because when we do git stash we were taking all the changes that were in that stash
 but not getting rid of that stash 
 
 -> git checkout -- . (that reset us back where we are )
 
 -> git stash list
 -> git stash pop (it will grab the very first stash in the list stash)
 
 * it will apply those changes and drop the stash 
 
 -> git stash list (it will not show the poped stash)
 
 -> git diff (we can see those changes)
 
 * make some changes
 
 -> git diff (chnage wiil reflect)
 
 * now someone told we have add some functionality
 
 -> git stash save "message"
 -> git stash list
 
 * add those functionality 
 
 -> git diff (we can see that added functionality)
 -> git stash save "added the function"
 -> git stash list ( two stash will be on the list and most recent on the top)
 -> git stash pop ( it will pop the recent stash )
 
 -> git stash drop stash@{2} - delete the specified stash
 
 -> git stash clear - delete all the stash file
