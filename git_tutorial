# difference between Central VCS(SVN) and Distributed VCS(Git)
-> Centralized version control systems are based on the idea that there is a single central copy of your project
somewhere (probably on a server), and programmers will commit their changes to this central copy.

“Committing” a change simply means recording the change in the central system.
Other programmers can then see this change. They can also pull down the change,
and the version control tool will automatically update the contents of any files that were changed.

WorkFlow:
->Pull down any changes other people have made from the central server.
->Make your changes, and make sure they work properly.
->Commit your changes to the central server, so other programmers can see them.
